### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a designer, leader, mentor, husband and father living in beautiful Queensland, Australia. I can't call myself a professional developer at the moment, though being a front end developer has been a big part of my professional career, I am someone who loves to write code.

I have a tonne of private repos here on Github and I am slowly releasing more public repos in a hope someone will find the code as useful as I have.

Anyways take a look around and fork away if something interests you.
